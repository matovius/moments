# CHANGELOG

## Bring in the landing page - v0.1.0 - 2024-08-20

Okay, I got motivated to work on this once more and I found that using a popup as a landing is a little silly. So I've decided to make a full landing page and waitlist page for the first minor version of the app. Let's see what we've got here:

- A spanking landing page with brief descriptions of the feature set and some good CTAs.
- A super simple waitlist page to capture emails from potential users.
- Foundations for an overhauled demo app

## Initial Commit - v0.0.1 - 2024-08-06

Hello, World! This is the first deployement of Moments. This is meant to be a purely demonstrational presentation. This means that there will be lots of additions and changes to come before we hit v1.0.0 of the app. But for now, here's what we have:

- A demo journal to play around with taking notes/journaling using plain text.
- You can selectively delete a single entry from the demo journal.
- You can clear all the entries in the demo journal at once from the header dropdown menu.

Thank you for visiting, and here's to more updates and a brighter future.
