# CHANGELOG

## Initial Commit - v0.0.1 - 2024-08-06

Hello, World! This is the first deployement of Moments. This is meant to be a purely demonstrational presentation. This means that there will be lots of additions and changes to come before we hit v1.0.0 of the app. But for now, here's what we have:

- A demo journal to play around with taking notes/journaling using plain text.
- You can selectively delete a single entry from the demo journal.
- You can clear all the entries in the demo journal at once from the header dropdown menu.

Thank you for visiting, and here's to more updates and a brighter future.
